# Bootstrap-Portfolio-Challange-3
This is our 3rd week challange Building Portfolio Website using Bootstrap


## Project Description:
This is 3rd week challenge building a responsive portfolio with placeholder text and images using Bootstrap classes.


## Approach:
I planned my website on paper and I was sure about the section I needed from the brief. To achieve this task I have taken help from Bootsrtap.
In the HTML section I copied basic codes from bootstrap and removed unncessary classes.
in the CSS section I created a new css and linked it to html. I kept inforcing and tweaking wherever spaces were needed. 


# HTML:
HTML was built with Bootsrap classes which built the whole skeleton of my website. HTML was the stepping stone of my website and I planned all the sections and parts before I start. 



# CSS:
As we are using Bootsrap for CSS styling but there where areas where I had to tweak and amend. So, I added local CSS file to the HTML and keep styling as and when needed. 


# Responsiveness and Media Queries:
Responsiveness came from Bootstrap, I knew how to use boxes by using col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-4. But not for all sections as Contact form needed to be shown in full so kept it 12 grid on all 3 sizes.


# Techenologies:
This project was built with
Bootsrap 
HTML and CSS.


## Deploy:
I deploy this website by using GitHub commands 
Git Clone, git add., git push.
And shared a live link for review.


## License:
I have added a MIT license. This is free website and anyone can use it.
